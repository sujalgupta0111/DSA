		    -->it use for run time
		    -->it use for dynamic memory allocation, meaning objects are 
		       allocated space as needed while the program is running.
		    -->Garbage Collector manages the heap, automatically freeing memory 
		       from objects no longer in use, preventing memory leaks.
		  
Pool memory--> duplicate values not allowed here  so if string of same name with   
		       different  variables created then all variable points to the same 
		       string that exists in  memory  
           --> pool memory is a region inside heap memory
		   --> String pool is managed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) 
		        and is specifically intended for immutable String literals.
		   --> no need for garbage collection
